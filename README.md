My final project for Consensys Developer Bootcamp is available on this link : https://did-for-dases.on.fleek.co/

### Decentralized Identity (DID) for Data Space Education and Skills (DaSES)

--- 

The purpose of this project is the creation of a DID for identification, authentication, signature and data flow traceability for DaSES.
The decentralized identity will be used to store and share authenticated data, consents, data sharing agreements and proofs by using Verifiable Credentials (VC).

DaSES will be a space for exchange and decentralized storage about data education and skills from a multi-party ecosystem.

This DID will allow governance and data flow into the space using [GAIA-X ecosystem] (https://www.gaia-x.eu/)
This project is using SSI Kit provided by walt.id
